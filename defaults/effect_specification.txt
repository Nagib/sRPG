This is a list of all effects that may be used in passives, actives, or as job bonuses
the modes for use as a job bonus are 'maximum' (the specified value is the value at max-level, the increase per level is evenly split over all levels), 'per-level' (total bonus is level times the specified value), 'static' (the specified value is a one-off bonus independent of level)
All effects are summed up for every instance of it in some job, so the same effect multiple times stacks unless specified otherwise

###############
special fields:
  'value' can be a float or int and will be used as applies to the effect
  'chance' as a float between 0.0 and 1.0 defines the percentage chance of the effect being triggered
  'tools' (list of material ids or material group names) specifies the tools with which the effect works if the tool is in hand
  'versus' (same as tools) specifies the tools or blocks onto which the effect works, either as a environmental block (for drop chances for example) or the opponents hand item (for combat-related effects)
  'level-based' (string list) can reference other (numerical) nodes of the effect to only use the percentage of the given value corresponding to currentlevel divided by maxlevel
  'inherited' (boolean, defaults to false) specifies if the effect is inheritable 
  'as-attacker' (boolean, defaults to true) makes the effect available in combat as the attacker
  'as-defender' (boolean, defaults to false) makes the effect available in combat as the defender
